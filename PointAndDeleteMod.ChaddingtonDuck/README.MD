# PointAndDeleteMod.ChaddingtonDuck 
This mod allows you to delete anything your character is pointing at using the hotkey set in scripts/main.lua
Default hotkey is F3

### WARNING
Be aware that you can delete anything, even things that will break your game/end your run/softlock you.
Resetting the cycle seems to reload everything and set things back to normal.
Known ingame issues:
- Deleting bosses hardcrashes the game to desktop
- You can delete the floor you're standing on and get stuck in an infinite fall loop until death
- You can delete critical progression items and softlock yourself
- Probably other things I forgor
